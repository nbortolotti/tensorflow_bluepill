# TensorFlow BluePill 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nbortolotti/tensorflow_bluepill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nbortolotti/tensorflow_bluepill)


## Setup & initial considerations

In this project, the main objective is to use an implementation style for developers applying eager mode. It is also proposed to use the TensorFlow 2 version, currently in alpha version. For the representation of models, the development is oriented to use Keras to solve the experiences.


## Prescription 1

general experiences using TensorFlow concepts.


*   tensors, shape, types and slices.
*   constants, variables
*   arrays and tensors operations


## Prescription 2

Experience across a regression model representation, case wine-quality dataset model.



*   extract information
*   normalization
*   build a model
*   train a model
*   evaluate a model
*   implement predictions


## Prescription 3

Experience of a categorization model representation, case Iris dataset model. 



*   extract information
*   build a model
*   train a model
*   evaluate a model
*   implement predictions


## Prescription 4

Using the wine quality dataset of prescription 2, we will re design the experience to represent a categorization model.  



*   extract information
*   build a model
*   train a model
*   evaluate a model
*   implement predictions


## Prescription 5

into this section we will review the experience to 



*   save a model
*   restore a model
*   use TensorFlow serving architecture across docker
*   Serve 1 model developed into experiences 2-3-4. 


## Anexo, Google Cloud Platform 



*   VM with GPU support into Google Cloud Platform.
*   Implementation of matrix multiplication
*   Implementing serving production environment into kubernetes engine 


## General examples

*   device_check: analyzing performance using a generic operation cpu and gpu device
