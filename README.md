# TensorFlow 2 BluePill 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nbortolotti/tensorflow_bluepill.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nbortolotti/tensorflow_bluepill)

## Setup & initial considerations
In this project, the main objective was to use an implementation style for developers applying eager mode. It is also proposed to use the TensorFlow 2 version, currently in alpha version. 
For the representation of models, the development is oriented to use Keras to solve the experiences.
## General examples
* device_check: analyzing performance using a generic operation cpu and gpu device

## Prescription 1
general experiences using TensorFlow concepts.
* constants
* variables
## Prescription 2
Experience across a regression model representation.
* extract information
* normalization
* build a model
* train a model
* evaluate a model
* implement predictions
